# MailGuard AI: Spam Email Classifier

MailGuard AI is a Machine Learning-based application designed to classify emails as spam or not spam, helping users safeguard their inboxes from unwanted or malicious content. Built with Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface, MailGuard AI leverages a pre-trained model to deliver accurate results.
